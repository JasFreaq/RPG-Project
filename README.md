# RPGProject
This is the source code for a personal project made using Unity. It aims to replicate the likes of point-and-click role-playing action adventure games such as Diablo and Divinity, to name a few.

Features include,

- A complete combat and movement system with an expandable equipment and pickup system.
- A complete inventory system.
- A dialogue and quest system complete with a custom dialogue editor is being worked upon currently.

Feel free to reach out if this project has been of any assistance to you as a reference or otherwise, if you would like to discuss about game development and design with a fellow practitioner, or if you would like to just make a contact in the field.
